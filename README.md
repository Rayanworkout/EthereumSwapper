# Ethereum Swapper

Some Rust ðŸ¦€ code to perform swaps on Ethereum through the Uniswap V2 router using [Alloy](https://alloy.rs/index.html).

Use it through CLI.

This is just a simple script I wrote to deepen my understanding of Rust and the Ethereum ecosystem. It is not production-ready and should not be used as such.
Feel free to customize it to your needs.
